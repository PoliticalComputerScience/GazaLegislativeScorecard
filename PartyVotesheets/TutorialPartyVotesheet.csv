11/14/23,This Senate vote would have blocked a bill that appropriated over $14 billion for additional military support for Israel. This money would have been taken from the IRS's budget. This money would have gone directly to procurement of missiles and to anti-air systems used in the Iron Dome. To clarify-- a yes vote is a vote against additional money to the Israeli military ,Helps,https://voteview.com/rollcall/RS1180309,51-48 (Passes),0,51,51.5,100,0,"Butler-- Y

1/16/24,This Senate vote would have required the United States to investigate Israel's human rights practices and prepare a publically available report. This would have been a very basic firs t step in providing information to both Congress and the United States about the extent of human rights abuses in Gaza and how effective international aid efforts have been. The bill was sponsored by Bernie Sanders and was tabled (rejected) 72-11. Here's how every senator voted on the vote to TABLE that bill (yes indicates that the bill will be rejected):,Hurts,https://voteview.com/rollcall/RS1180360,72-11 (Passes),33,39,86.7,79.6,97.1,"Butler-- N

1/18/24,"This Senate vote would have amended a bill funding the federal government to prevent the US from providing aid to Gaza, the West Bank, or the Palestinian Authority. The amendment, if passed, would significantly limit the amount of funding available for humanitarian aid to Gaza and the West Bank",Hurts,https://voteview.com/rollcall/RS1180362,44-50 (Fails),43,1,46.8,2,100,"Butler-- N

2/13/24,"An earlier version of the massive aid package to Ukraine and Israel. Much of the description here is copied from April 23, 2024 vote as the legislation was nearly identical and many of the same methodological problems apply. This is the Senate's initial pass vote on the $95.3B aid bill to Ukraine and Israel, small amounts of humanitarian aid to Gaza and Sudan amongst other places, and more. To be clear, this bill is somewhat nuanced and this is reflected in the debate over the bill in the Congressional Record as well as the actual voteshares-- many Republicans rejected the bill over support to Ukraine while progressive Democrats rejected the bill over support to Israel. This is largely because centrists blocked the measure from being split so that progressives wouldn't vote against it (as they favor humanitarian aid and support to Ukraine) and the fringe of the right wouldn't either (as they favor aid to Israel). Nevertheless, the bill is listed as harming Gaza as it both a. provides nearly $9B to the Israeli military and b. defunds the UNRWA and makes it more difficult for the UNRWA (which provides lifesaving basic assistance and medical care) to operate within Gaza. However, note that I considered not including this bill because htis vote is actively misleading. I would love to find amendment votes specific to aid to Israel as a better gauge of support. Most of that amendment process happened in the House, but I'm actively searching for Senate votes on each amendment to the bill in the Senate. Remember when interpreting this data that it doesn't make much sense, for omnibus bills like this, to extrapolate from votes to support for individual provisions. Senators Sanders, Merkley, and Welch, though, opposed the bill (per the Congressional Record) out of opposition to expanding funding for the Israeli military. Aggregate numbers may be misleading, as this is an omnibus bill ",Hurts,https://voteview.com/rollcall/RS1180400,70-29 (passes),22,46,70.7,94.1,44.9,"Butler-- Y

3/22/24,"This is a vote on a similar aid package to 4/23 vote and 2/13 vote. This bill contained a wide variety of provisions but would limit any contributions made by the United States to the UNRWA and would transfer additional funds to Israel for missiles, the Iron Dome, and a variety of other defense programs. Some block assistance (assistance given without directives as to how to spend that money) is also given to Israel. Simialr to 2/13 and 4/23, only certain dissenting votes are votes that are ""about"" Gaza, and as such, only certain dissenting votes are granted the green marker (notably, the Senate GOP attempted to insert amendments curtailing immigration to the United States, preventing trans students from playing school sports, and more and, when such amendments were rejected, certain hardline GOP senators refused to support the omnibus package altogether). As such, aggregate numbers may be misleading.",Hurts,https://voteview.com/rollcall/RS1180455,78-18 (passes),28,48,81.3,98,62.2,"Butler-- Y
