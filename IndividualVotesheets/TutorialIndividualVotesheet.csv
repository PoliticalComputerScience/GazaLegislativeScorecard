11/14/23 vote would have blocked a bill that appropriated over $14 billion for additional military support for Israel. This money would have been taken from the IRS's budget.

"1/16/24 vote would have required the United States to investigate Israel's human rights practices and prepare a publically available report. This would have been a very basic firs t step in providing information to both Congress and the United States about the extent of human rights abuses in Gaza and how effective international aid efforts have been. Further, this bill proposed conditioning aid to Israel on Israeli compliance with international human rights law, a step already taken by many nations. The bill was sponsored by Bernie Sanders and was tabled (rejected) 72-11.

"2/13/24 vote An earlier version of the massive aid package to Ukraine and Israel. Much of the description here is copied from April 23, 2024 vote as the legislation was nearly identical and many of the same methodological problems apply. This is the Senate's initial pass vote on the $95.3B aid bill to Ukraine and Israel, small amounts of humanitarian aid to Gaza and Sudan amongst other places, and more. To be clear, this bill is somewhat nuanced and this is reflected in the debate over the bill in the Congressional Record as well as the actual voteshares-- many Republicans rejected the bill over support to Ukraine while progressive Democrats rejected the bill over support to Israel. This is largely because centrists blocked the measure from being split so that progressives wouldn't vote against it (as they favor humanitarian aid and support to Ukraine) and the fringe of the right wouldn't either (as they favor aid to Israel). Nevertheless, the bill is listed as harming Gaza as it both a. provides nearly $9B to the Israeli military and b. defunds the UNRWA and makes it more difficult for the UNRWA (which provides lifesaving basic assistance and medical care) to operate within Gaza. However, note that I considered not including this bill because htis vote is actively misleading. I would love to find amendment votes specific to aid to Israel as a better gauge of support. Most of that amendment process happened in the House, but I'm actively searching for Senate votes on each amendment to the bill in the Senate. Remember when interpreting this data that it doesn't make much sense, for omnibus bills like this, to extrapolate from votes to support for individual provisions.  For now, only senators who actively voiced opposition to provisions granting Israel unrestricted military aid are given ""green"" scores.

"3/22/24 vote on a similar aid package to 4/23 vote and 2/13 vote. This bill contained a wide variety of provisions but would limit any contributions made by the United States to the UNRWA and would transfer additional funds to Israel for missiles, the Iron Dome, and a variety of other defense programs. Some block assistance (assistance given without directives as to how to spend that money) is also given to Israel.
